% Optimization
% "Classic" density approach to topology optimization. Each element is
% assigned a density variable that is used to penalize its stiffness.
TOPOLOGY_OPTIMIZATION= YES
% The element design densities come from the 6th column of this file,
% these are the variables the optimizer should manipulate.

% Filtering is required to avoid numerical issues, see [Sigmund, 2007]
% (DOI 10.1007/s00158-006-0087-x). Currently available options:
% CONSTANT;  CONICAL (default);  GAUSSIAN;  DILATE;  ERODE.
% The filter can have multiple sequential stages (2 in this case).

% Each kernel can have its own radius (R1, R2, ...) or one value can be
% specified for all.

% Again this can be a list.
TOPOL_OPTIM_KERNEL_PARAM= 200
% After the filtering, a projection step can be applied to increase the
% solid-void contrast, i.e. the discreteness of the solution. Options:
% NO_PROJECTION (default);  HEAVISIDE_UP;  HEAVISIDE_DOWN.
TOPOL_OPTIM_PROJECTION_TYPE= NO_PROJECTION
% The continuous Heaviside function (step) approximations require a
% parameter, large value equals more discrete.
